## tl;dr;
To get up and developing;
* We use the fork & pull Git model, fork a local copy.
* Install Git, Node
* Run `npm install` to install all NPM packages.
* Run `npm run sandbox` to start up sandbox.

Contributing Guide
==================

Let's build something awesome. We can make it happen with your help.

We use the [fork & pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#fork--pull) to accept new code into the project. If you aren't familiar with that workflow, Github's [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) article is a great primer.

If you plan on contributing more than once and want to keep your fork up to date with this project we recommend checking out these guides on [configuring a remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork) and [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).

## Getting Involved

The easiest way to get involved is to join in the conversation on this repositories issue tracker. This is where we work out ideas for new features and fixes. Once we have the details worked out here we can easily implement against a defined specification.

## Adding Code

We make use of the [airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Please make sure that all contributed code is in line with this style guide. Code will be rejected if it is not in line with this standard.

## Environment Setup

To get developing you will need to have a few programs.

### 1. Git

Follow the [installation instructions](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on the git website to get setup with git.

*Note For Windows Users*: mysysgit comes with a tool called `git bash` which is the recommened shell to run commands in.

### 2. Node.js and NPM

Next make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. If you are unsure if you have Node on your computer you can run this command in your terminal to check.

```bash
$ node -v
```

If your terminal returns a version number then you are good to go. If it does not return a version number then visit the [Node.js downloads page](http://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download and install a copy on your machine.

With the Node.js installer you will also get the NPM CLI (Node Package Manager Command Line Interface) which your computer will use to download packages from the NPM registry.

### 3. Install modules

```
$ npm i
```

### 4. Sandbox

You can view your directives in a runtime environment as you develop.  The sandbox environment will allow you to test runtime markup and options.  The sandbox is a page on the BossyUI website, to run the website locally:

```bash
$ npm start
```

You can then see changes you are making to directives as you develop them at [http://localhost:3000/sandbox](http://localhost:3000/sandbox).

## Creating or Modifying Directives

Before you start work please create an Issue in this repo.  The Issue title should reflect the Directive/Widget you are working on, ie:

"GRAPH: Short description on what you are working on"

Your working branch should be named with both the Directive/Widget name and the Issue number, ie:

"GRAPH-1234"

When committing code, you will need to prefix your comments with the branch name.  Pull request will be rejected if these rules are not met.

## Finding Bugs?

We don't write perfect software and systems and platforms change, so if you've found a bug log it in the issue tracker so we can get started fixing it.
