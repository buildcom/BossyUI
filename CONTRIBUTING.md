Contributing Guide
==================

Let's build something awesome. We can make it happen with your help. We use the [fork & pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#fork--pull) to accept new code into the project. If you aren't familiar with that workflow, Github's [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) article is a great primer.

## Getting Involved

The easiest way to get involved is to join in the conversation on this repositories issue tracker. This is where we work out ideas for new features and fixes. Once we have the details worked out here we can easily implement against a defined specification.

## Adding Code

If you want to dive in and help contribute some code we'll have some coding guidelines for you to checkout soon. Stay tuned.

## Finding Bugs?

We don't write perfect software and systems and platforms change, so if you've found a bug log that in the issue tracker so we can get started fixing it.
